### Project description
ðŸš€ This project aims to expand knowledge of the GraphQL protocol and implement a reactive backend with SpringWebflux, where domain, services, data fetchers are emulated and finally applying principles of the library provided by Netflix, the GraphQL DGS.

### GraphQL DGS
The Domain Graph Service is a GraphQL framework integrated with SpringBoot developed by Netflix. Created by facebook, in 2019 Netflix decided to implement a GraphQL architecture with the purpose: To provide a unified Api for its consumers and query flexibility for the backend. With a robust architecture, DGS was developed based on the implementation of GraphQL for Java. With the library mostly being developed in Kotlin, the library was designed to have a lot of Spring and Java integration. Realizing how much a community could add to this architecture that uses a lot of annotations model, Spring Security integration and error handling. It was in 2020 that Netflix decided to open the framework's source code and what we came across is the already known components of the famous OSS framework.
